This is a Twitter application built for HP/Palm webOS before it went downhill. This code is about 3 years old, but represents a great deal of work.
Everything was also designed by me. Almost the entire interface is custom.

Some kind things Palm [said about TweetMe](http://developer.palm.com/blog/2010/05/this-week-in-hot-apps/): How did Tweet Me rise so quickly even though the competition has been going for more than three months? Simple: they wrote a great looking apps with good features. Every screen of Tweet Me shows incredible attention to detail. It has become my personal favorite Twitter app thanks to the great use of notifications. Not only does the app show me when I have new tweets, but it uses a nice glowing dot to indicate which category of tweets has been updated. The guys at Catalyst Media Studios of done a great job.
